| Version   | Supported          |

| <= 0.13.x | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability ##

To report possible security vulnerabilities with supported versions, please use
our [official GitHub security page](https://github.com/glektarssza/minecraft-high-res-screenshots/security).

This is the quickest and easiest way to report possible security vulnerabilities
and get the attention of developers working on the project.

Security vulnerability reports are triaged with within 48 hours of being
reported to determine legitimacy. If a vulnerability is determined to be
legitimate (e.g. not falsified or spurious) you can expect to receive updates on
the investigation and efforts to remediate the issue every 24 hours after the
initial triage completion.

If your report is accepted you will be credited as the reporter and an advisory
will be issued.

If your report is declined no advisory will be issued and no further action will
be taken.

If you submit multiple reports that are found to not be legitimate this will
result in investigation into your reporting patterns. If there is a consistent
pattern of abusive reporting you will be banned from participation in the
project (reporting security vulnerabilities, filing issues, opening pull
requests, etc.). In extreme cases you will be banned from participation in any
repository under the root account/organization this repository lives beneath.
